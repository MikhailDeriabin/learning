# JavaScript Objects and Functions 2

## About

This week covers objects and functions again, but with more advanced uses. These code patterns are what brings out the full power of JS and are essential for understanding JS code libraries that you might use for bigger projects.

In particular, the todo app in the `advanced_obj_fun` directory contains some example code that uses many of the key techniques you need to learn.

## Priority of Labs

* Basics
	- first_class_functions.html
	- function_closure.html
	- js_classes.html
* Intermediate
	- prototype_inheritance.html
	- extending_js_types.html
* Advanced
	- advanced_obj_fun/
		* js/
			- model.js
			- store.js
			- app.js
		* index.html

For the advanced lab code, the application uses other files than those listed. However, by studying the four files listed above you will see how to implement the model part of __Model__ _View Controller_.
